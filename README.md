# Paradox '22 Website

Some simple instructions:
- If you know SCSS, make sure you compile the files in `production` mode and avoid sourcemaps, any code with sourcemaps will be rejected.
- If you don't know SCSS, add your code to `dev.css`, let the SCSS developers handle it.
- `js` folder will have all the JavaScript related files, we are using jQuery (v3.1.1), so feel free to utilise that.
- Every endpoint (webpage) has a separate page (`.html` file) in the project.
- We will use firebase for the database / CMS operations, make sure you know your way around that.
