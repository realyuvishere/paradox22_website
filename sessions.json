        "desc": "In this workshop, participants will be introduced to the exciting science of networks, and how they find far-reaching applications in biology. Do you know, that the same algorithms used to suggest friends in Facebook, are also useful in biology, to predict which proteins will interact? How do diseases such as COVID permeate through social contact networks? What are the groups of proteins that are involved in a disease? How can we identify novel pathways to synthesis drugs and other chemicals",

        "desc": "A core element of the Unix philosophy is to favour simple and modular programs that can then be used to compose larger and more complex programs by constructing so-called \"pipelines\". This basic idea can be generalized to the concept of task graphs and scheduling, which has applications across several domains of interest. This also leads to interesting applications of the ideas of functional programming and analysis.</p><p>In this talk, we will look at several examples of how the concept of pipelines can be generalized from the command line all the way to the design of high performance hardware, and present some pointers for further study.",

        "desc": "Machine learning has enabled a rediscovery of an old adage. Combining multiple \"weaker\" models is often far superior to complex models. This manifests in two distinct ways: 1. Parallel learning of individual weak models combined via majority voting, 2. Sequential learning of weak models, each additional model focusing on the weaknesses of previous models. We will take an elementary peek into both these paradigms, in which multiple models are combined to make a more powerful model.",
