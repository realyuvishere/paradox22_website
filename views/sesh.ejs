                    <p>In this workshop, participants will be introduced to the exciting science of networks, and how they find far-reaching applications in biology. Do you know, that the same algorithms used to suggest friends in Facebook, are also useful
                        in biology, to predict which proteins will interact? How do diseases such as COVID permeate through social contact networks? What are the groups of proteins that are involved in a disease? How can we identify novel pathways to
                        synthesis drugs and other chemicals?p>

                    <p>The session will provide an introduction to problems in medical image analysis. Students will learn about different types of medical imaging systems and the types of images acquired using the same. They will learn how techniques in
                        linear algebra, statistics and ML can be applied to solve problems arising in medical imaging analysis.</p>

                    <h1>The Power of Pipelines</h1>
                    <p>A core element of the Unix philosophy is to favour simple and modular programs that can then be used to compose larger and more complex programs by constructing so-called "pipelines". This basic idea can be generalized to the concept
                        of task graphs and scheduling, which has applications across several domains of interest. This also leads to interesting applications of the ideas of functional programming and analysis.</p>
                    <p>In this talk, we will look at several examples of how the concept of pipelines can be generalized from the command line all the way to the design of high performance hardware, and present some pointers for further study.</p>

                    <p>In this talk, we introduce how to apply data analytics in the education domain. We will provide an overview of how Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Algorithms can be applied to the data from the educational domain to provide
                        better teaching-learning experiences. We will explore a few examples of how learning analytics can be applied to data from different learning environments like classrooms, and online and intelligent tutoring systems. In the end,
                        we will discuss the research works in LA at ET-IITB.</p>

                    <p>As part of this workshop, we will cover Jax, which is a machine learning library developed by Google. JAX is NumPy on the CPU, GPU, and TPU, with great automatic differentiation for high-performance machine learning research. We will
                        learn the basics of the Jax API. We will train a neural network model written in Jax as part of hands-on experience of this workshop. We will also implement logistic regression from scratch.

                    <p>You need to bring your laptop for hands-on exercises in the workshop. We will use colab as a front end for coding.

                    <h1>The Wisdom of the Many: Ensemble Methods in Machine Learning</h1>
                    <p>Machine learning has enabled a rediscovery of an old adage. Combining multiple "weaker" models is often far superior to complex models. This manifests in two distinct ways: 1. Parallel learning of individual weak models combined via
                        majority voting, 2. Sequential learning of weak models, each additional model focusing on the weaknesses of previous models. We will take an elementary peek into both these paradigms, in which multiple models are combined to make
                        a more powerful model.
